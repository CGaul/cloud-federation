\chapter{Introduction}
Give insight about the importance of the Cloud-Federation topic.



\section{Research Aspects}
- What kind of Research was already made by other parties? Which projects evolved from them?
- Describe own research that could be done.


\section{Development Aspects}
- Where is the focus in the development part of the master thesis?
- More implementation and technological overviews are given in the next chapter (technological Overview)


\section{Economical Aspects}
- Apart from research, is there a Economical benefit foreseeable from that topic?
- Which econonomic aspects are already of interest in Cloud Computing / Virtualization in general?
\subsection{Economies of Scale}
- Cost advantages for Cloud-provider / Cloud user, based on small, unique Servers on the Company side
\subsection{Energy Efficiency}
- Current European Research Project on Federated Clouds and the idea to swap work, based on the presence of renewable energy
- e.g. use Cloud in the north of Germany, if enough wind-energy is provided, swap to Cloud in the south of Spain, if energy from noon-sun could be used.
\subsection{Service License Agreements in a Federation}
- How could SLAs be handled autonomously on a pre-defined set of economic settings (price per MB/Bandwidth, price per Compute-Unit, priorization of users)
- Interesting Economical Aspect: Provide many small clouds over different regions in the world
- Offer federations, based on closest proximity to clients.
